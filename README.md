## MATLAB Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

### Features

- **Bubble Sort Visualizer**: Shows how the Bubble Sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
  
- **Insertion Sort Visualizer**: Demonstrates the Insertion Sort algorithm, which iterates through an array and places each element in its correct position relative to the sorted part of the array.

### Motivation

The project was created to visually illustrate the mechanics of fundamental sorting algorithms using MATLAB's plotting capabilities. By visualizing each step of the sorting process, users can grasp the inner workings of these algorithms more intuitively.
